# Hospital Lab Management System

Welcome to the Hospital Lab Management System, a digital sanctuary for managing laboratory activities within a hospital setting. Unleash its power on your local machine and dive into the world of health-tech wizardry.

## Technologies Used

This enchanted system is forged with the following mystical technologies:

- **HTML**: The foundation of the digital realm, providing structure and form.
- **CSS**: Weaving the visual enchantment to make your experience magical.
- **JavaScript**: The sorcerer's language, bringing interactivity and dynamism.
- **PHP**: Channeling the magic behind the scenes, making things happen.
- **MySQL**: The sacred repository, storing and retrieving knowledge.

## Setup Instructions

To bring this system to life on your own turf, follow these enchanting steps:

### 1. Install Xampp Server

Download and install Xampp, the dynamic duo of Apache server and MySQL.

[Download Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)

### 2. Start Apache and MySQL Servers

Activate both the Apache and MySQL servers using the Xampp control panel. Let the server symphony begin!

### 3. Open PhpMyAdmin Panel

Enter the mystical realm of PhpMyAdmin through the Xampp control panel.

### 4. Create a New Database

Summon a new database into existence named "lab" within PhpMyAdmin. This is where the magic happens!

### 5. Import Database Schema

Invoke the power of the `lab.sql` file into your "lab" realm. This sacred scroll contains the mystical tables required for the system to thrive.

### 6. Configure Apache Port (if necessary)

Perform a ritual in the Apache config file if the default port `localhost:80` is occupied. Change all occurrences of '80' to '8080' and let the digital winds guide you.

### 7. Place Code Folder in the Xampp Htdocs Realm

Before you embark on the grand journey through `localhost:8080`, place the code folder inside the repository into the htdocs folder. It's where Xampp resides, waiting for its coding companion.

### 8. Run the Project

Unleash the magic by opening your browser and journeying to `localhost:8080`. Behold the creation in its full glory!

## Additional Note

For the full mystical experience, delve into the included report document. It holds the secrets of the Database design, a tome of knowledge encompassing scope, requirements, Entity-Relational diagrams, schema, and the divine relational tables. It's not just a document; it's a journey into the heart of the system.
