# Hospital Lab Management System

Welcome to the Hospital Lab Management System, a sophisticated solution for seamlessly overseeing laboratory activities within a hospital environment. Harness its capabilities on your local machine and immerse yourself in the realm of cutting-edge health-tech.

## Technologies Utilized

This advanced system is crafted with a blend of powerful technologies:

- **HTML**: Forming the structural backbone, offering order and coherence.
- **CSS**: Enchanting visuals to elevate your user experience.
- **JavaScript**: The language of interactivity and dynamism, adding finesse to functionality.
- **PHP**: Behind-the-scenes orchestration, making operations seamless.
- **MySQL**: The venerable repository, securely storing and retrieving crucial information.

## Setup Instructions

To deploy this system on your own domain, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Xampp Server

Download and install Xampp, a powerful duo encompassing the Apache server and MySQL.

[Download Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)

### 2. Launch Apache and MySQL Servers

Initiate both the Apache and MySQL servers using the Xampp control panel. Let the server symphony commence!

### 3. Access PhpMyAdmin Panel

Navigate to the realm of PhpMyAdmin through the Xampp control panel.

### 4. Establish a New Database

Summon a new database into existence named "lab" within PhpMyAdmin. This is where the system's operations come to life!

### 5. Import Database Schema

Invoke the magic within the `lab.sql` file to instantiate the necessary tables for the system to flourish.

### 6. Configure Apache Port (if necessary)

Perform an adjustment in the Apache config file if the default port `localhost:80` is unavailable. Change instances of '80' to '8080' and let the digital winds guide you.

### 7. Position Code Folder in the Xampp Htdocs Directory

Before embarking on the journey through `localhost:8080`, place the code folder from the repository into the htdocs folder, the dwelling place of Xampp.

### 8. Launch the Project

Unleash the potential by opening your browser and navigating to `localhost:8080`. Witness the creation in its full glory!
